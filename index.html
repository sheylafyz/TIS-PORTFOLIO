										<h2><a href="#">ASSIGNMENT 1 :<br />VISIT TO NALI 2023</a></h2>
									</header>
									<a href="#" class="image fit"><img src="images/poster 1.jpg" alt="" /></a>
									<p>That day I was looking for sources to interview, but I was interested in this booth after seeing the learning tools they made. This tool is a tool for learning with new and unique innovations. Students will get challenges from this tool which must be completed. After that, on the side of the tool, they will get a prize or reward that they can collect themselves. Therefore, students will not get bored easily and be lazy. On the contrary, students will get the satisfaction and addiction of learning this method. Such as the positive impact that has been mentioned on the poster, it enhances student engagement, encourages collaboration, critical thinking, and adaptability.
										In my opinion, with all features and benefits of learning with this method, I am personally very interested in trying it because this method is very interesting and fun to try.</p>

										<h2><a href="#">ASSIGNMENT 2 :<br />
										INDUSTRIAL TALK</a></h2>
									</header>
									<a href="#" class="image fit"><img src="images/assignment 2.jpg" alt="" /></a>
									<p>In an inspiring presentation by Mr. Yee Soon Tuck from Clarity Techworks, he shared a crucial message: each morning, we're already behind in the fast-moving tech scene. This shows how important it is to keep learning and stay updated with the newest developments in technology. He emphasized the significance of getting to grips with areas like machine learning and artificial intelligence, as they're transforming our use of data and tech. He also highlighted that tech jobs now require more than just technical know-how. Employers value soft skills such as creativity, the ability to solve problems, teamwork, and good communication. These are really important to improve skills by taking on new challenges that help us learn more about ourselves and advance professionally as he recommended. This reminds us that the journey of learning in the tech field is ongoing, pushing us to continually adapt and enhance our abilities.</p>

										<h2><a href="#">ASSIGNMENT 3 :<br />
										</a>VIDEO VISIT UTM DIGITAL</h2>
									</header>
									<a href="#" class="image fit"><img src="images/assignment 3.jpg" alt="" /></a>
									<p>On December 5th, I joined a Webex session by UTM Digital, skillfully moderated by Dr. Aryati, which lasted two enlightening hours. The talk gave a comprehensive overview of working within UTM Digital, touching on digital services, infrastructure, networking, ICT security management, and system development. It expanded my understanding of ICT services at UTM, like the UTMID for network access, UTMSmart for administrative tasks, and how Microsoft 365 enhances education. Learning about the digital infrastructure, such as 24/7 data center operations and firewall-protected data, alongside cloud services like Google Workspace and Webex for video conferencing, was intriguing. The session also highlighted UTM's robust network improvements and detailed ICT security efforts, including web activity monitoring and a cyber command center for data protection. The adoption of the scrum method for system development illustrated UTM Digital's innovative approach to work and decision-making. Overall, this informative session not only broadened my knowledge but also impressed me with the scope of UTM Digital's efforts and the tangible benefits they provide.</p>

										<h2><a href="#">PC ASSEMBLE<br /></a></h2>
									</header>
									<a href="#" class="image fit"><img src="images/pc assemble.jpg" alt="" /></a>
									<p>PC assembling is our lab activity, where we have to disassemble and then reassemble or put back together the components as they were originally. The challenge that can be taken is remembering the steps to reassemble the compartments back to their original state. In addition, we can also recognize the tools by looking directly and knowing their uses. This experience is very useful for us to know the uses of PC tools and also to identify possible errors that may occur if something happens in the future.</p>

										<h2><a href="#">DESIGN THINKING</a></h2>
									</header>
									<a href="#" class="image fit"><img src="images/brainstorming.jpg" alt="" /></a>
									<p>My ultimate goal in taking this course is to secure the job I aspire to, and to that end, I am fully committed to enhancing my learning and deepening my knowledge. Beyond just aiming for career success, I'm on a quest for personal development, seeking to build a robust set of skills and to engage with new experiences that will forward my personal and professional growth. Through this program's design thinking approach, I've come to understand that creations and solutions might be temporary, but the ability to innovate and solve problems endures. It teaches me the significance of not only spotting potential issues but also refining my ability to devise solutions and gather new knowledge as I chase my aspirations. To boost my potential in the industry, I plan to actively pursue continuous learning and skill enhancement by staying abreast of the latest trends, acquiring certifications, participating in workshops and trainings, and cultivating a network of professionals who can offer mentorship. Securing hands-on experience through internships or projects is also on my agenda. My commitment is to remain flexible and receptive to new technologies and methodologies, ensuring I am well-prepared for the evolving industry landscape.</p>
